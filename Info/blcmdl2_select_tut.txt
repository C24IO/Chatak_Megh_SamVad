    DESCRIPTION

*select* (or *pselect*) is the pivot function of most C programs that
handle more than one simultaneous file descriptor (or socket handle) in
an efficient manner. Its principal arguments are three arrays of file
descriptors: /readfds/, /writefds/, and /exceptfds/. The way that
*select* is usually used is to block while waiting for a "change of
status" on one or more of the file descriptors. A "change of status" is
when more characters become available from the file descriptor; /or/
when space becomes available within the kernel's internal buffers for
more to be written to the file descriptor, /or/ when a file descriptor
goes into error (in the case of a socket or pipe this is when the other
end of the connection is closed).

In summary, *select* just watches multiple file descriptors, and is the
standard Unix call to do so.

The arrays of file descriptors are called /file descriptor sets/. Each
set is declared as type *fd_set*, and its contents can be altered with
the macros *FD_CLR*, *FD_ISSET*, *FD_SET*, and *FD_ZERO*. *FD_ZERO* is
usually the first function to be used on a newly declared set.
Thereafter, the individual file descriptors that you are interested in
can be added one by one with *FD_SET*. *select* modifies the contents of
the sets according to the rules described below; after calling *select*
you can test if your file descriptor is still present in the set with
the *FD_ISSET* macro. *FD_ISSET* returns non-zero if the descriptor is
present and zero if it is not. *FD_CLR* removes a file descriptor from
the set although I can't see the use for it in a clean program.

 


    ARGUMENTS

/readfds/
    This set is watched to see if data is available for reading from any
    of its file descriptors. After *select* has returned, /readfds/ will
    be cleared of all file descriptors except for those file descriptors
    that are immediately available for reading with a *recv()* (for
    sockets) or *read()* (for pipes, files, and sockets) call. 
/writefds/
    This set is watched to see if there is space to write data to any of
    its file descriptor. After *select* has returned, /writefds/ will be
    cleared of all file descriptors except for those file descriptors
    that are immediately available for writing with a *send()* (for
    sockets) or *write()* (for pipes, files, and sockets) call. 
/exceptfds/
    This set is watched for exceptions or errors on any of the file
    descriptors. However, that is actually just a rumor. How you use
    /exceptfds/ is to watch for /Out of Bounds/ (OOB) data. OOB data is
    data sent on a socket using the *MSG_OOB* flag, and hence
    /exceptfds/ only really applies to sockets. See *recv
    </library/cmd/blcmdl2_recv.htm>*(2) and *send
    </library/cmd/blcmdl2_send.htm>*(2) about this. After *select* has
    returned, /exceptfds/ will be cleared of all file descriptors except
    for those descriptors that are available for reading OOB data. You
    can only ever read one byte of OOB data though (which is done with
    *recv()*), and writing OOB data (done with *send*) can be done at
    any time and will not block. Hence there is no need for a fourth set
    to check if a socket is available for writing OOB data. 
/n/
    This is an integer one more than the maximum of any file descriptor
    in any of the sets. In other words, while you are busy adding file
    descriptors to your sets, you must calculate the maximum integer
    value of all of them, then increment this value by one, and then
    pass this as /n/ to *select*. 
/utimeout/

        This is the longest time *select* must wait before returning,
        even if nothing interesting happened. If this value is passed as
        *NULL*, then *select* blocks indefinitely waiting for an event.
        /utimeout/ can be set to zero seconds, which causes *select* to
        return immediately. The structure *struct timeval* is defined as,

struct timeval {
    time_t tv_sec;    /* seconds */
    long tv_usec;     /* microseconds */
};

/ntimeout/

        This argument has the same meaning as /utimeout/ but *struct
        timespec* has nanosecond precision as follows,

struct timespec {
    long tv_sec;    /* seconds */
    long tv_nsec;   /* nanoseconds */
};

/sigmask/
    This argument holds a set of signals to allow while performing a
    *pselect* call (see *sigaddset
    </library/cmd/blcmdl3_sigaddset.htm>*(3) and *sigprocmask
    </library/cmd/blcmdl2_sigprocmask.htm>*(2)). It can be passed as
    NULL, in which case it does not modify the set of allowed signals on
    entry and exit to the function. It will then behave just like *select*.

 


    COMBINING SIGNAL AND DATA EVENTS

*pselect* must be used if you are waiting for a signal as well as data
from a file descriptor. Programs that receive signals as events normally
use the signal handler only to raise a global flag. The global flag will
indicate that the event must be processed in the main loop of the
program. A signal will cause the *select* (or *pselect*) call to return
with *errno* set to *EINTR*. This behavior is essential so that signals
can be processed in the main loop of the program, otherwise *select*
would block indefinitely. Now, somewhere in the main loop will be a
conditional to check the global flag. So we must ask: what if a signal
arrives after the conditional, but before the *select* call? The answer
is that *select* would block indefinitely, even though an event is
actually pending. This race condition is solved by the *pselect* call.
This call can be used to mask out signals that are not to be received
except within the *pselect* call. For instance, let us say that the
event in question was the exit of a child process. Before the start of
the main loop, we would block *SIGCHLD* using *sigprocmask*. Our
*pselect* call would enable *SIGCHLD* by using the virgin signal mask.
Our program would look like:

int child_events = 0;

void child_sig_handler (int x) {
    child_events++;
    signal (SIGCHLD, child_sig_handler);
}

int main (int argc, char **argv) {
    sigset_t sigmask, orig_sigmask;

    sigemptyset (&sigmask);
    sigaddset (&sigmask, SIGCHLD);
    sigprocmask (SIG_BLOCK, &sigmask,
                                &orig_sigmask);

    signal (SIGCHLD, child_sig_handler);

    for (;;) { /* main loop */
        for (; child_events > 0; child_events--) {
            /* do event work here */
        }
        r = pselect (n, &rd, &wr, &er, 0, &orig_sigmask);

        /* main body of program */
    }
}

Note that the above *pselect* call can be replaced with:

        sigprocmask (SIG_BLOCK, &orig_sigmask, 0);
        r = select (n, &rd, &wr, &er, 0);
        sigprocmask (SIG_BLOCK, &sigmask, 0);

but then there is still the possibility that a signal could arrive after
the first *sigprocmask* and before the *select*. If you do do this, it
is prudent to at least put a finite timeout so that the process does not
block. At present glibc probably works this way. The Linux kernel does
not have a native *pselect* system call as yet so this is all probably
much of a mute point.

 


    PRACTICAL

So what is the point of *select*? Can't I just read and write to my
descriptors whenever I want? The point of select is that it watches
multiple descriptors at the same time and properly puts the process to
sleep if there is no activity. It does this while enabling you to handle
multiple simultaneous pipes and sockets. Unix programmers often find
themselves in a position where they have to handle IO from more than one
file descriptor where the data flow may be intermittent. If you were to
merely create a sequence of *read* and *write* calls, you would find
that one of your calls may block waiting for data from/to a file
descriptor, while another file descriptor is unused though available for
data. *select* efficiently copes with this situation.

A classic example of *select* comes from the *select* man page:

#include <stdio.h <file:/usr/include/stdio.h>>
#include <sys/time.h <file:/usr/include/sys/time.h>>
#include <sys/types.h <file:/usr/include/sys/types.h>>
#include <unistd.h <file:/usr/include/unistd.h>>

int
main(void) {
    fd_set rfds;
    struct timeval tv;
    int retval;

    /* Watch stdin (fd 0) to see when it has input. */
    FD_ZERO(&rfds);
    FD_SET(0, &rfds);
    /* Wait up to five seconds. */
    tv.tv_sec = 5;
    tv.tv_usec = 0;

    retval = select(1, &rfds, NULL, NULL, &tv);
    /* Don't rely on the value of tv now! */

    if (retval)
        printf("Data is available now.\n");
        /* FD_ISSET(0, &rfds) will be true. */
    else
        printf("No data within five seconds.\n");

    exit(0);
}

                    SHUT_FD1;
                } else
                    buf2_written += r;
            }

            if (FD_ISSET (fd2, &wr)) {
                r =
                    write (fd2,
                           buf1 + buf1_written,
                           buf1_avail -
                           buf1_written);
                if (r < 1) {

/* check if write data has caught read data */
        if (buf1_written == buf1_avail)
            buf1_written = buf1_avail = 0;
        if (buf2_written == buf2_avail)
            buf2_written = buf2_avail = 0;

   writing to the other side until empty */

            && buf1_avail - buf1_written == 0) {
            SHUT_FD2;

            && buf2_avail - buf2_written == 0) {

    }
    return 0;
}

The above program properly forwards most kinds of TCP connections
including OOB signal data transmitted by *telnet* servers. It handles
the tricky problem of having data flow in both directions
simultaneously. You might think it more efficient to use a *fork()* call
and devote a thread to each stream. This becomes more tricky than you
might suspect. Another idea is to set non-blocking IO using an *ioctl()*
call. This also has its problems because you end up having to have
inefficient timeouts.

The program does not handle more than one simultaneous connection at a
time, although it could easily be extended to do this with a linked list
of buffers - one for each connection. At the moment, new connections
cause the current connection to be dropped.

 


    SELECT LAW

Many people who try to use *select* come across behavior that is
difficult to understand and produces non-portable or borderline results.
For instance, the above program is carefully written not to block at any
point, even though it does not set its file descriptors to non-blocking
mode at all (see *ioctl </library/cmd/blcmdl2_ioctl.htm>*(2)). It is
easy to introduce subtle errors that will remove the advantage of using
*select*, hence I will present a list of essentials to watch for when
using the *select* call.

*1.*
    You should always try use *select* without a timeout. Your program
    should have nothing to do if there is no data available. Code that
    depends on timeouts is not usually portable and difficult to debug. 
*2.*
    The value /n/ must be properly calculated for efficiency as
    explained above. 
*3.*
    No file descriptor must be added to any set if you do not intend to
    check its result after the *select* call, and respond appropriately.
    See next rule. 
*4.*
    After *select* returns, all file descriptors in all sets /must/ be
    checked. Any file descriptor that is available for writing /must/ be
    written to, and any file descriptor available for reading /must/ be
    read, etc. 
*5.*
    The functions *read()*, *recv()*, *write()*, and *send()* do /not/
    necessarily read/write the full amount of data that you have
    requested. If they do read/write the full amount, its because you
    have a low traffic load and a fast stream. This is not always going
    to be the case. You should cope with the case of your functions only
    managing to send or receive a single byte. 
*6.*
    Never read/write only in single bytes at a time unless your are
    really sure that you have a small amount of data to process. It is
    extremely inefficient not to read/write as much data as you can
    buffer each time. The buffers in the example above are 1024 bytes
    although they could easily be made as large as the maximum possible
    packet size on your local network. 
*7.*
    The functions *read()*, *recv()*, *write()*, and *send()* as well as
    the *select()* call can return -1 with an errno of *EINTR* or
    *EAGAIN* (*EWOULDBLOCK*) which are not errors. These results must be
    properly managed (not done properly above). If your program is not
    going to receive any signals then it is unlikely you will get
    *EINTR*. If your program does not set non-blocking IO, you will not
    get *EAGAIN*. Nonetheless you should still cope with these errors
    for completeness. 
*8.*
    Never call *read()*, *recv()*, *write()*, or *send()* with a buffer
    length of zero. 
*9.*
    Except as indicated in *7.*, the functions *read()*, *recv()*,
    *write()*, and *send()* never have a return value less than 1 except
    if an error has occurred. For instance, a *read()* on a pipe where
    the other end has died returns zero (so does an end-of-file error),
    /but/ only returns zero once (a followup read or write will return
    -1). Should any of these functions return 0 or -1, you should /not/
    pass that descriptor to select ever again. In the above example, I
    close the descriptor immediately, and then set it to -1 to prevent
    it being included in a set. 
*10.*
    The timeout value must be initialized with each new call to
    *select*, since some operating systems modify the structure.
    *pselect* however does not modify its timeout structure. 
*11.*
    I have heard that the Windows socket layer does not cope with OOB
    data properly. It also does not cope with *select* calls when no
    file descriptors are set at all. Having no file descriptors set is a
    useful way to sleep the process with sub-second precision by using
    the timeout. (See further on.)

 


    USLEEP EMULATION

On systems that do not have a *usleep* function, you can call *select*
with a finite timeout and no file descriptors as follows:

    struct timeval tv;
    tv.tv_sec = 0;
    tv.tv_usec = 200000;  /* 0.2 seconds */
    select (0, NULL, NULL, NULL, &tv);

This is only guarenteed to work on Unix systems, however.

 


    RETURN VALUE

On success, *select* returns the total number of file descriptors still
present in the file descriptor sets.

If *select* timed out, then the file descriptors sets should be all
empty (but may not be on some systems). However the return value will
definitely be zero.

A return value of -1 indicates an error, with *errno* being set
appropriately. In the case of an error, the returned sets and the
timeout struct contents are undefined and should not be used. *pselect*
however never modifies /ntimeout/.

 


    ERRORS

*EBADF*
    A set contained an invalid file descriptor. This error often occurs
    when you add a file descriptor to a set that you have already issued
    a *close* on, or when that file descriptor has experienced some kind
    of error. Hence you should cease adding to sets any file descriptor
    that returns an error on reading or writing. 
*EINTR*
    An interrupting signal was caught like *SIGINT* or *SIGCHLD* etc. In
    this case you should rebuild your file descriptor sets and retry. 
*EINVAL*
    Occurs if /n/ is negative. 
*ENOMEM*
    Internal memory allocation failure.
